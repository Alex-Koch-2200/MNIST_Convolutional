# MNIST_Convolutional
Convolutional neural network built with Tensorflow in Python to classify the digits in the MNIST data set and then classify my own handwriting. Over 99% accuracy is obtained after ~2000 iterations.

My own digits, 0-9, are also included as theses were used as a quick test of the accuracy of the data on digits outside of the orginal MNIST data set. The digits were made according to the original prescription found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
